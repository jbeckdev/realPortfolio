# This WAS my Portfolio. New One Created.

My Developer Portfolio. Work in progress.

Eventually, this will be what I direct clients and prospective employers to, in order to view my work and show off my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. 

My goals for this portfolio are as follows: Make it extremely fast and lightweight, Fully Responsive on all devices, and to provide an easy way to get in touch with me.

It uses Smooth Scrolling, and I'm hoping to add Parallax effects to the images as well as some nice animations. 

I'll keep updating as I push more changes.
