# This is my Portfolio. 

My Developer Portfolio. Work in progress.

Eventually, this will be what I direct clients and prospective employers to, in order to view my work and show off my HTML, CSS, and JavaScript knowledge. 

My goals for this portfolio are as follows: Make it extremely fast and lightweight, Fully Responsive on all devices, and to provide an easy way to get in touch with me.

I'll keep updating as I push more changes.
